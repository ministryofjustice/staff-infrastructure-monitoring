Enabling alerting:
1. add a notification channel
  - email notification channel doesn't require extra set up (that's managed by AWS)
  - for slack you will need to set the web hook to be the same as the web hook configured for your slack channel
2. add an alert
  - this can be done by going to edit a panel and following the instructions found in the alert tab
